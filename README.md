# VL.HardwareMonitor
Based on the [LibreHardwareMonitorLibCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibreHardwareMonitorLibCore/) nuget which in turn is a fork of the original [OpenHardwareMonitor](https://openhardwaremonitor.org/).

NOTE:
- When using this as a vl source-package for the first time you'll see red nodes. Open VL.HardwareMonitor, go to Dependencies and rightclick on the missing nuget > Install.
- Certain sensor values require the program to run with admin rights!
